# Standard Workflow Instructions

This repo centralizes agent guidance in:
- `AGENTS.md` (repo root)
- `.devagent/plugins/ralph/AGENTS.md` (Ralph plugin playbook)

When workflows reference this file, follow the instructions in those sources. No additional core-specific workflow rules are required here.
