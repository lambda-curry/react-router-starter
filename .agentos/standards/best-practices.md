# Best Practices (Global Standard)

- Small vertical slices: spec → plan → tasks → implement → review
- TDD bias: write contracts/tests first; keep failing tests visible
- Avoid speculative architecture until needed ≥ 3 times
- Document decisions as ADRs in .agentos/product/decisions
- Keep specs living; update spec/plan when reality changes
- Prefer composition over inheritance; data flows explicit
- Accessibility: aim for WCAG 2.1 AA; semantic markup; focus states
