It requires documentation implementation (README, usage examples, Storybook, testing patterns), so the **engineering** label was applied. Code Wizard should implement the work.\n\n**Scope (acceptance criteria):**\n1. **Update README with new features** — Reflect epic deliverables: Storybook, Lambda Curry Forms, testing examples, Biome, AI rules. Ensure root README and any app-level docs are consistent (e.g. scripts: `bun` at root, `npm run` / `bun` in apps/todo-app per package.json).\n2. **Add usage examples** — Short, copy-pasteable examples (e.g. running dev, adding a todo, running tests, opening Storybook).\n3. **Document Storybook commands** — In README and/or docs: `npm run storybook` / `bun run storybook` (port 6006), `npm run build-storybook` / `bun run build-storybook`. Mention where stories live (e.g. `app/components/*.stories.tsx`).\n4. **Document testing patterns** — Either extend root README or point to `apps/todo-app/TESTING.md`. Cover: unit vs component vs integration, `renderWithRouter`, test scripts (`test`, `test:run`, `test:ci`, `test:ui`), and where tests live.\n\n**References:**\n- Root: `README.md`\n- App: `apps/todo-app/package.json` (scripts), `apps/todo-app/TESTING.md`\n- Storybook: `apps/todo-app/.storybook/`, stories in `app/components/*.stories.tsx`\n\nAfter implementation: run quality gates (lint/typecheck/test), commit with task ID, then close the task and add Commit + Revision Learning comments.\n\nSigned: Project Manager Agent — Chaos Coordinator\n","created_at":"2026-02-02T07:06:57Z"},{"id":14,"issue_id":"react-router-starter-p5l.7","author":"Jake Ruesink","text":"Commit: 0075a61 - docs: update README and testing docs (react-router-starter-p5l.7) [skip ci]\n\nSigned: Engineering Agent — Code Wizard\n","created_at":"2026-02-02T07:09:35Z"},{"id":15,"issue_id":"react-router-starter-p5l.7","author":"Jake Ruesink","text":"Revision Learning:\n**Category**: Documentation\n**Priority**: Low\n**Issue**: README had duplicate \"Styling\" sections and did not reference Storybook, Lambda Curry Forms, or TESTING.md.\n**Recommendation**: Keep a single source of truth for script names (root vs app) and link to FORMS_INTEGRATION.md and apps/todo-app/TESTING.md from README so docs stay discoverable.\n**Files/Rules Affected**: README.md, apps/todo-app/TESTING.md\n\nSigned: Engineering Agent — Code Wizard\n","created_at":"2026-02-02T07:09:35Z"},{"id":16,"issue_id":"react-router-starter-p5l.7","author":"Jake Ruesink","text":"Summary: README updated with new features (Storybook, Lambda Curry Forms, Biome, AI rules), usage examples, Storybook commands and story paths, and testing patterns with link to apps/todo-app/TESTING.md.
